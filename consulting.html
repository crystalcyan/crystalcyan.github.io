My workshops leverage an experiential learning model, with detailed case studies, interactive activities, small group discussion, and tailored feedback. Additionally, I lead some of my most popular <a href="about.html#speaking">talks and workshops at select conferences worldwide</a>. Some of these include:</p> 
        <h5 id="hcdleader">Level Up Your Leadership with Human-Centered Design (talk or workshop)</h5>
	Beyond changing interfaces, human-centered design can influence big leadership decisions. In this talk, I'll share how you can increase your influence and hone your strategic leadership skills by focusing on the four ways human-centered design can impact your organization—product and service delivery, hiring and building a team, training and strengthening interdisciplinary teams, and human-centered policymaking. Additionally, you will learn the top three skills you will most need to develop in order to truly make an impact as a strategic leader in your organization.
	<h5 id="datadesign">Data + Design: Mixed Methods Research in the Real World (workshop)</h5>
	While introductory courses to UX describe research methods in an ideal setting (inside an organization that already understands and values discovery), bringing a mixed methods research approach to solving UX problems in the real world is a different story. In this workshop, we’ll use real-world examples and case studies to show how data made (and can make) a difference in a designer’s decision-making process. We'll cover defining different types of data and research methods, setting a product metrics strategy and defining goals, designing experiments around goals to test hypotheses, and delivering insights that inform decisions. You'll leave with actionable takeaways for how to set product success metrics, create testable hypotheses, how to interpret and analyze the results of data analysis tools, and how to know when to use qualitative methods to validate or modify your design decisions.
	<h5 id="asylum">Product Strategy for Humanitarian Immigration Services (talk)</h5>
	In a place far from home, how do refugees and asylum seekers find information about and understand how to navigate a complex government process of applying for asylum? In this presentation, I’ll share how our team conducted human-centered design research with asylum seekers for the US asylum program, how those insights illuminated areas of improvement for content strategy and service design, and how we redesigned content and services while balancing needs for ease of use and data security. Finally, I'll show how product strategy work illuminated the need for overhauling our overall organization's strategy. You'll leave this session with insight into the opportunity and impact of thoughtful product strategy in government, examples from specific case studies featuring the work of the United States Digital Service in designing products and services for asylum seekers, and recommendations on how to apply these lessons to your own product strategy work.
	<h5 id="researcheveryone">Building a Customer-Centric Culture by Democratizing Research (talk or workshop)</h5>
	When you’re building, not optimizing, you need everyone to learn from customers. But how do you build a team culture in which everyone, including backend engineers and compliance program managers, feels empowered to do research? I’ll share what I’ve learned so far on creative methods for how to coach, how to share insights, and how to impact company policies. You’ll walk away with a new approach to teaching non-researchers how to research, sharing insights from customers that get heard and impact decisions, and finally, ideas for selling your organization on policies that enable a more customer-centric culture.
	<h5 id="aicurtain">Behind the AI Curtain - Designing for Machine Learning Products (talk)</h5>
        When startups first launch, they can make the news with application of cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) - but convincing users to trust the AI is often another story. This session covers three key principles for how design and data science teams can work together better to build greater trust among users. Additionally, a case study on how a design and data science team partnered to redesign predictive analytics scores powered by machine learning will illustrate those principles in practice.</br>
	<h5 id="biasuncovered">Bias, Uncovered (talk or workshop)</h5>
        Are you ready to confront bias? In this interactive session, you’ll be challenged to uncover your own cognitive biases and explore how understanding them can help us design for the behaviors we encounter every day. You’ll get a crash course in three particular cognitive biases (anchoring bias, confirmation bias, and social proof), and learn more about their applications in the real world. Most importantly, you'll walk away with actionable ideas for how to leverage this understanding to design more inclusive user research and hiring practices, so that you can design more inclusive and equitable products/services and teams.
        <h5 id="designinghiring">Build a Better Hiring Process with Design Thinking (talk)</h5>
        How do leading organizations hire effectively? Hear how one hiring manager used behavioral science research insights and human-centered design principles to uncover pain points and opportunities in the candidate journey, facilitate a co-design activity to paper prototype potential solutions, and create a more intentional and fair interview process. Whether you're looking to lead and build out your own hiring process, or you're job searching and want to hear a hiring manager's perspective, this session will help you learn best practices from leading technology corporations, startups, and consulting firms.
        <h5 id="zerototest">Zero to Test - How to Run Your First Beta Testing Program (talk)</h5>
	Beyond getting out of the building and talking to users, some of the most valuable insights you can gather come from putting a prototype in a user's hand and learning more about how they use it over time. In this workshop, we'll cover how to sell the idea of beta testing to your manager or your client, how to integrate qualitative and quantitative UX research into the design and development lifecycle and best practices for working effectively with client success/account management (for B2B) or user support (for B2C), and how to draw valuable user insights from beta testing feedback.
