				<h2>Consulting</h2>
				<p>I coach product and design teams at early and growth stage startups. I coach PMs, designers, and marketers on customer development and bringing new products to market: running customer interviews, and designing and testing prototypes. Additionally, I specialize in coaching founders and heads of product on hiring their first PM/designer, building product teams, and building product-led companies.</p>

	<h3>One-Time Sessions</h3>
	<h4>Product Strategy Session</h4>

	<h4>Design Review</h4>
	<p>Need feedback on a critical user experience? <a href="https://superpeer.com/crystalyan">Schedule a design review</a>. I'd love to learn more about your goals and how I can help.

        <h3>Consulting Engagements</h3>
        <p>For product managers/designers/marketers looking to level up on customer development or founders looking to level up on product leadership, I offer consulting engagements on retainer. Most engagements include a weekly 1:1 strategy session with a key member of your team (typically the head of product or design), centered around key topics we outline at the start of the consulting engagement based on your goals. Before, between and after sessions, I contribute as your head of product/design's superpower by creating custom templates and resources to help them strategize, execute, and learn from customers better and faster.</p>
