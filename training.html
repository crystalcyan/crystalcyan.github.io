				<h2>Speaking & Training</h2>	
        <p>Level up your team by bringing my training to you. I lead tailored, private talks and workshops for teams looking to train up on topics including Leading Design Sprints, Design Research Methods, Creating a Customer Centric Culture, Designing Teams and Organizations, and Product Strategy. My workshops leverage an experiential learning model, with detailed case studies, interactive activities, small group discussion, and tailored feedback. Additionally, I lead some of my most popular <a href="#speaking">talks and workshops at select conferences worldwide</a>. Some of these include:</p> 
        
	<h4 id="talks">Talks</h4>
	<p>For organizations looking for speakers for a team offsite or company event, or event organizers looking for speakers for a conference or webinar series, I offer talks (on-site or virtual) on a range of topics. Select from one of my existing talks or <link href="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" type="text/javascript"></script><a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/crystalcyan'});return false;">contact me</a> to learn more about booking a custom talk.</p>
	<h5 id="asylum">Product Strategy for Humanitarian Immigration Services (talk)</h5>
	In a place far from home, how do refugees and asylum seekers find information about and understand how to navigate a complex government process of applying for asylum? In this presentation, I’ll share how our team conducted human-centered design research with asylum seekers for the US asylum program, how those insights illuminated areas of improvement for content strategy and service design, and how we redesigned content and services while balancing needs for ease of use and data security. Finally, I'll show how product strategy work illuminated the need for overhauling our overall organization's strategy. You'll leave this session with insight into the opportunity and impact of thoughtful product strategy in government, examples from specific case studies featuring the work of the United States Digital Service in designing products and services for asylum seekers, and recommendations on how to apply these lessons to your own product strategy work.
	<h5 id="aicurtain">Behind the AI Curtain - Designing for Machine Learning Products (talk)</h5>
        When startups first launch, they can make the news with application of cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) - but convincing users to trust the AI is often another story. This session covers three key principles for how design and data science teams can work together better to build greater trust among users. Additionally, a case study on how a design and data science team partnered to redesign predictive analytics scores powered by machine learning will illustrate those principles in practice.</br>
        <h5 id="researcheveryone">Building a Customer-Centric Culture by Democratizing Research (talk)</h5>
	When you’re building, not optimizing, you need everyone to learn from customers. But how do you build a team culture in which everyone, including backend engineers and compliance program managers, feels empowered to do research? I’ll share what I’ve learned so far on creative methods for how to coach, how to share insights, and how to impact company policies. You’ll walk away with a new approach to teaching non-researchers how to research, sharing insights from customers that get heard and impact decisions, and finally, ideas for selling your organization on policies that enable a more customer-centric culture.
        <h5 id="designinghiring">Build a Better Hiring Process with Design Thinking (talk)</h5>
        How do leading organizations hire effectively? Hear how one hiring manager used behavioral science research insights and human-centered design principles to uncover pain points and opportunities in the candidate journey, facilitate a co-design activity to paper prototype potential solutions, and create a more intentional and fair interview process. Whether you're looking to lead and build out your own hiring process, or you're job searching and want to hear a hiring manager's perspective, this session will help you learn best practices from leading technology corporations, startups, and consulting firms.

        <h4 id="workshops">Workshops</h4>
	<p>For organizations looking to upskill their team, I lead corporate training workshops (on-site or virtual). Select from one of my existing workshops, or we can work together to design a custom learning experience tailored to your team's needs. I typically teach a 1-2 hour, half day, or full day workshop for groups of 10-50.
	<p>For conference organizers looking to add workshops to their conference program, I lead corporate training workshops (on-site or virtual). Select from one of my existing workshops, or we can work together to design a workshop that aligns to your conference theme. I typically teach a half day or full day workshop for groups of 10-50.

	<h5 id="systemsforspeaking">Systems for Speaking + Launch Your Lightning Talk (workshop)</h5>
	Create more serendipity in your career by speaking. Speaking can make you a better writer, thinker, and teacher. While most people find public speaking intimidating, you don't need to become a professional keynote speaker at conferences to see the results from getting better at speaking. Learning to craft a great 5 minute lightning talk is the first step to building the confidence to speak up and provide insight in that weekly team meeting, and build executive presence. In this interactive workshop, you'll master the strategies and systems you need to build a consistent public speaking habit, and put them into practice by launching your first lightning talk. I'll cover how I got started with giving my first conference talk years ago, and the six strategies I use to build a consistent public speaking habit that's taken me to speak in many settings, ranging from lightning talks with my team or at local meetups to keynotes at international conferences. Then, I'll do a brief demo of a lightning talk. Next, I'll lead an interactive workshop in which you design a lightning talk, then gather in small groups to present and get feedback. Finally, we'll wrap with Q&A for your small group.
	<h5 id="datadesign">Data + Design: Creating a Test & Learn Culture on Your Team (workshop)</h5>
	Are you a UX designer looking to develop product thinking skills, or a product manager looking to better understand the value of UX? In this workshop, we’ll use real-world examples and case studies to show how to leverage data and design to create a test & learn culture on your product and UX team. We'll cover how product and UX can successfully partner through different stages of product development, and you'll leave with actionable frameworks and takeaways for using qualitative and quantitative research methods, setting a product metrics strategy and defining shared goals, creating testable hypotheses and solutions, designing experiments to test hypotheses, and delivering insights that inform decisions.
        <h5 id="hcdleader">Level Up Your Leadership with Human-Centered Design (talk and/or workshop)</h5>
	     Beyond changing interfaces, human-centered design can and should influence senior leadership decisions. In this workshop, I'll share how you can increase your influence and hone your strategic leadership skills by focusing on the four ways human-centered design can impact your organization—products and services, people, process, and policy. Additionally, we'll go through exercises to practice the top three skills you will most need to develop in order to truly make an impact as a strategic leader in your organization.
	      <h5 id="biasuncovered">Bias, Uncovered (talk and/or workshop)</h5>
        Are you ready to confront bias? In this interactive session, you’ll be challenged to uncover your own cognitive biases and explore how understanding them can help us design for the behaviors we encounter every day. You’ll get a crash course in three particular cognitive biases (anchoring bias, confirmation bias, and social proof), and learn more about their applications in the real world. Most importantly, you'll walk away with actionable ideas for how to leverage this understanding to design more inclusive user research and hiring practices, so that you can design more inclusive and equitable products/services and teams.
