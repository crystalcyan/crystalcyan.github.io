				<h2>Services</h2>
				<p>I work with product and design teams, startup founders, and agencies on projects that range from designing and testing prototypes to bring new products to market, to training teams on human-centered design and agile product development. Additionally, I specialize in leading design sprints and integrating behavioral science and machine learning into products.</p>
        </br>
        <h4>Product Management, Product Design, and User Experience (UX) Research</h4>
        <p>Create a product and experience your customers will love. I help my clients with product management, UX research, interaction design, UX design, prototyping, user interface (UI) design, branding, visual design, data analysis and storytelling.</p>
        <p><a href="index.html#works">Learn more about my work</a> and <a href="mailto:yan.crystal.c@gmail.com">contact me</a> to learn more about how I can help your team.</p>
        </br>
        <h4>Workshops</h4>
        <p>Transform your organization by bringing my corporate training and coaching to you. I lead tailored, private workshops for teams looking to level up on topics including Leading Design Sprints, Design Research Methods, Designing a Better Hiring Process, Designing for Machine Learning Products, Designing for Behavior Change, and Kickstarting a Design System. My workshops leverage an experiential learning model, with detailed case studies, interactive activities, small group discussion, and tailored feedback. Additionally, I lead some of my most popular <a href="about.html#speaking">talks and workshops at select conferences worldwide</a>. Some of these include:</p> 
        <h5>Behind the AI Curtain - Designing for Trust in Machine Learning Products</h5>
        When startups first launch, they can make the news with application of cutting edge artificial intelligence (AI) - but convincing users to trust the AI is often another story. There's often also no process for integrating future AI development into product roadmaps. This session covers three key principles for how design and data science teams can work together better to build greater trust among users. Additionally, a case study on how a design and data science team partnered to redesign predictive analytics scores powered by machine learning will illustrate those principles in practice.</br>
        <h5>Zero to Test - How to Run Your First Beta Testing Program</h5>
        Beyond getting out of the building and talking to users, some of the most valuable insights you can gather come from putting a prototype in a user's hand and learning more about how they use it over time. In this conversation, we'll cover how to sell the idea of beta testing to your manager or your client, how to integrate qualitative and quantitative UX research into the design and development lifecycle and best practices for working effectively with client success/account management (for B2B) or user support (for B2C), and how to draw valuable user insights from beta testing feedback.</br>
        <h5>Bias, Uncovered</h5>
        Are you ready to confront bias? In this interactive session, you’ll be challenged to uncover your own cognitive biases and explore how understanding them can help us design for the behaviors we encounter every day. You’ll learn about three particular cognitive biases, their applications in the real world, and through an interactive installation, you’ll learn what biases everyone around us has seen.
        <h5>Applying Design Thinking to Hiring - Designing a Better Hiring Process for Optimizing Delight and Diversity</h5>
        How do leading organizations hire effectively? Hear how one hiring manager used behavioral science research insights and human-centered design principles to uncover pain points and opportunities in the candidate journey, write more inclusive job descriptions, advocate for investing in many candidate outreach channels, and create a more intentional and fair interview process. Whether you're looking to lead and build out your own hiring process, or you're job searching and want to hear a hiring manager's perspective, this session will help you learn best practices from leading technology corporations, startups, and consulting firms.
